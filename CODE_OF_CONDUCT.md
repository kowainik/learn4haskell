# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate
in the Kowainik organization.

We invite all those who participate in Kowainik to help us to create safe
and positive experiences for everyone.

## Our Standards

A primary goal of Kowainik is to make the Haskell open source community friendlier.
As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
So, we are using the following standards in our organization.

### Be inclusive.

We welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes,
but is not limited to members of any sexual orientation, gender identity and expression,
race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, social and economic class, educational level,
colour, immigration status, sex, age, size, family status, political belief, religion,
and mental and physical ability.

### Be respectful.

We won't all agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for disrespectful behaviour.
We will all experience frustration from time to time, but we cannot allow that frustration
to become personal attacks. An environment where people feel uncomfortable or threatened
is not a productive or creative one.

### Choose your words carefully.

Always conduct yourself professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others.
Harassment and exclusionary behaviour aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

  * Threats of violence.
  * Discriminatory language.
  * Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
  * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviours.

### Don't harass.

In general, if someone asks you to stop something, then stop. When we disagree, try to understand why.
Differences of opinion and disagreements are mostly unavoidable. What is important is that we resolve
disagreements and differing views constructively.

### Make differences into strengths.

Different people have different perspectives on issues,
and that can be valuable for solving problems or generating new ideas. Being unable to understand why
someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that we all make mistakes,
and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere.

Instead, focus on resolving issues and learning from mistakes.

##  Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns,
please notify us as soon as possible.
